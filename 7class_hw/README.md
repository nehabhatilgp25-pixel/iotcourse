## 7class_hw
This project uses the NinjaIoT library.
The Dashboard_HW.html and arduinocode_LED&IR.cpp files are both part of this. They create a dashboard for the ESP controller which is connected to an IR sensor and LED. It can be controlled in 2 modes, automatic or manual. When in automatic, the LED turns on if the IR sensor detects an object and vice versa. The IR reading is also displayed on the dashboard. When in manual, the toggle switch on the dashboard controls the LED.
