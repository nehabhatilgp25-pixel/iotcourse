##  What This Is
This is an app and online dashboard which display the temperature, humidity and gas levels of the area where the sensors are placed.

---
## App Controls
The app has two modes, manual and automatic. Manual allows the user to control the LED, automatic makes the LED light up when any of the 3 factors (temperature, humidity or gas levels) are out of bounds. When in automatic mode, the LED cannot be controlled by the user.

Features I haven't implemented yet:
The buttons at the bottom of the page allow you to navigate to a new screen which displays the temperature and humidity.

## Bugs
The NinjaIot platform is getting updated with the correct LED status, but the actual physical LED is not changing.

When the app starts, it is by default in automatic mode. But the LED toggle switch is still moveable (it should be disabled initially since it should only be accessible in manual mode).
